# Jarvis-AI
Start Date : 1/14/20
I started this project with the intention of learning python and interest in artificial intelligence. 

ULTIMATE GOAL : to make him more sophisticated AI than it is right now. 

Things to do/idea to implement:
- features on voice change
- volume adjustment 

ADD_ON Feature later:
Scientific calculation
- Re-calculates the rate of redox reaction on laccase for biofuel cell on graphitic carbon (my previous research in graduate program)
- Re-evaluate the Raman data on nano carbon fibers. 
- Gives a visualization (using charts...?)
